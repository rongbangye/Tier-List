# Tier-List
A simple **dynamic** Tier List web app build with vanilla JavaScript along with drag and drop API and data transfer API inspired by Ijemma Onwuzulike
- create your own tier list
- drag and drop the card into a different tier 
- add or delete cards
- **persisting data locally**
- planning to add more features: 
  - implement login/sign up to save data in the backend
  - create multiple tier-list
